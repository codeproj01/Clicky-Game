# ClickyGame
This is a memory game built with React.JS. The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events. After each click the game shuffles the cards.

The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. 

If you repeat guesses, you lose and the score is reset to 0, but it keeps track of your top score.
